# Environment Setup for OpenSim RAG Project

## System Information
- Python version: 3.10.12
- Hardware: 128GB RAM, 2GB NVIDIA GPU (Note: NVIDIA drivers not detected)
- No sudo access available

## Libraries Installed

### Web Scraping
- beautifulsoup4
- requests

### Data Processing
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

### Vector Database and Embeddings
- faiss-cpu (for vector similarity search)
- gensim (for word embeddings)
- spacy with en_core_web_sm model (for NLP tasks)

### Web Interface
- flask
- markdown

## Setup Challenges and Solutions

### Virtual Environment Issues
- Attempted to create Python virtual environment using `venv` but failed due to missing system packages
- Attempted to use `virtualenv` but encountered timeout issues
- Solution: Used pip with `--user` flag to install packages in user space

### Memory Constraints
- Attempted to install `sentence-transformers` but encountered memory issues due to large dependencies like PyTorch
- Solution: Used lighter alternatives like `gensim` and `spacy` for text processing and embeddings

## Next Steps
1. Implement scrapers for OpenSim documentation
2. Collect data from GitHub repositories
3. Process the collected data for the RAG system
4. Implement the retrieval and generation components
5. Develop the HTML GUI interface
